# Sentiment-Analysis
The subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called sentiment analysis is concerned with analyzing the polarity of documents and learn how to use
machine learning algorithms to classify documents based on their polarity: the
attitude of the writer. In particular, we are going to work with a dataset of 50,000
movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and build a predictor
that can distinguish between positive and negative reviews. The topics that will be covered here are Cleaning and preparing text data,
Building feature vectors from text documents, Training a machine learning model to classify positive and negative movie
reviews, Working with large text datasets using out-of-core learning, Inferring topics from document collections for categorization
