# Sentiment-Analysis
The subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called sentiment analysis is concerned with analyzing the polarity of documents and learn how to use
machine learning algorithms to classify documents based on their polarity: the
attitude of the writer. In particular, we are going to work with a dataset of 50,000
movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and build a predictor
that can distinguish between positive and negative reviews.
